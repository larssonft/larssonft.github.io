Hello! 

My name is Fredrik Larsson, and I am currently pursuing a MS in Finance at USC Marshall School of Business. Please see a list of available projects below.

```

Porfolio Optimization using $\sum_{}^{-1}\times Risk Premium$ to solve for tangency portfolio. In this project, I construct 2 portfolios based on hisotrical data and compare them to SPY (S&P500 ETF) in 2019. It looks at the relative performance and how much the investor would have been compensated based risk levels. The conclusion is that a historical sharpe ratio is an insufficient measure to determine portfolio weights, although it is much more mathematical and computational intense.

```
Event study when LVMH announced that it will acquire Tiffany October 25th after market close. The study looks at whether insider trading might have occured prior to the announcement and whether the Tiffany stock conformed to semi-strong market hypothesis (as soon as new information arises, the market should adjust the price immediately). To measure abnormal returns, I used the CAPM model, which historically has explained ~70% of stock/portfolio movements. I conclude that there are insufficient evidence of insider trading and that markets follow semi-strong market hypothesis in this case.

thumbnail("Fama French - 3 Factor Model", "file:///C:/Users/fredr/Desktop/larssonft.github.io-master/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png", "Fama_French.html")
```
Since the uprise of CAPM, academia has tried to find new models to explain stocks and portfolio movements. Some of the best to date are the Fama French 3-Factor and 5-Factor Models. Many researchers, however, have tried to add more factors, but it has been unsuccessful as more independent variables tend to punish the model statistically: lower $adj. R^2$. Now, researchers and industry professionals are trying to find more meaningful variables. 

The 3 factors are: MRP (Market Risk Premium), HML (High minus Low), and SML (Small minus Big). I utilized ETFs to capture the different categories of stocks rather than downloading the whole market.
